# CSGO-External-Source
Csgo All in One External Source Code

Ok So To Be Clear Im Not Smart When It Comes To Adding Files To Github

So This Wont Work If You Just Download it

So I Suggest Copying and Pasting the following

CSGOBUPROJECT.cpp

Defines.h

Memory.h

offsets.h - Make sure they are updated

But If You Simply Just Copy and paste them with the same exact names Example (Memory.h) or (defines.h) 

then it will 100% work

if you have any issues Dm Me
